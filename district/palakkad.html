                <p class="card-text">The beautifully designed gardens of Malampuzha are one of the most attractive Palakkad tourist places. Lush green lawns that are paired with well laid out flower beds full of vibrant and bright colours, the abundance of majestic fountains and artistically designed sculptures make for an idyllic escape from city life.

                    The pollution fee environs will make it impossible for you to leave the place. The gardens also feature gorgeous swimming pools where you can go for a leisurely swim. The canal that runs through the centre of the gardens lends a surreal quality to the place.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Known for its eerie silence that will make you hear and see things you are not sure of, The Silent Valley National Park is one of the most curious Palakkad tourist places.

                    The untouched environs of the valley attract tourists every year to witness the cicadas rustling with the wind. The valley is an epitome of tranquillity and stands to provide a perfect escape from the humdrum of concrete jungles and everyday city life. The diverse flora and fauna and booming ecosystem make it a truly idyllic holiday destination.
